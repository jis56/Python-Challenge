PyBank

A Python script was created to analyze the financial records of a company. The financial data set is called budget_data.csv in the Resources folder and comprises of two columns: Data and Profit/Losses. This script analyzes the records to calculate the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2.The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3.The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

4.The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5.The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
In addition, the final script will also print the analysis to the terminal as well as export a text file to the "Analysis" folder.
